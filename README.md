# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### NOTES TO MYSELF
propType is a built-in system for making code more robust. First you import propTypes from prop-types. The we set the component.propTypes to an object, just like the default props object. If you then supply a different datatype as default props, you get a warning, just like typescript (catches errors before they happen). We can also make it required

# Styling
We can style React components inline using an object and passing it into a 'style' attribute in key-value pairs. We can also use a named object and pass it into the style attribute

# REACT ICONS
We can use font awesome cdn in our html file but we can install reacticons library in your project to be able to access built in icons that come with react. We use
### npm i react-icons

# JSON-SERVER
There is a tool called 'json-server' that allows us to create our own mock restAPI with our own data. We can use it from the web using npx and directly add our port number in a new terminal. This is obviously after creating the data folder in the root, the holds the .json file which we can then access in our components

### npx json-server -p 5000 -w data/db.json

To load up the data here, we can do the data fetch in another hook called useEffect. This hook runs a function after an effect happens or takes place and can also take in a 'dependency array' which holds the value or state or entity whose change causes the useEffect to happen

# ROUTING

We use routing by installing a package called react-router-dom

### npm i react-router-dom
